# Data Cleaning Project: NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess real-world messy data using Python. The dataset is collected from Kaggle.

## Features
- Removing duplicates.

- Standardizing column names.

- Cleaning string columns by handling spaces and replacing invalid entries with NaN.

- Converting date and time columns to appropriate formats.

- Processing numerical columns to ensure consistent integer values.

- Handling coordinates (LATITUDE, LONGITUDE) by converting to numeric and managing invalid entries.

- Identifying and reports outliers using the IQR method.

- Saving the cleaned dataset to a new file
